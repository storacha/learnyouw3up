# Infinite avatar compression!

YAS BOSS! That's how you do it! 

## Whatâ€™s the Deal with Content Addressing?

So, hereâ€™s the scoop: when you upload data to Storacha, it gets transformed into a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. Each piece of your data becomes a node, and each node gets a unique identifier called a **Content Identifier (CID)**. This whole DAG is then packed into a Content-Addressed Archive (CAR)â€”think of it like a digital suitcase for your data, ready to travel the web.

## How It Works:

When you upload a file, itâ€™s broken down into smaller pieces called **CAR shards**. Each shard gets its own CID, making it easy to identify and retrieve.
After all the shards are uploaded, they come together to form the full DAG, with a root CID that ties everything together.

Hereâ€™s the best part: If the system already has the data youâ€™re trying to upload, itâ€™ll tell you so. No need to send the data again! Itâ€™s like magicâ€”data management on autopilot! ðŸš—âœ¨

## Your Task:

**1. Start by creating a new file, like `ex5.mjs`.**

**2. Upload Content**

Youâ€™ll upload a fileâ€”maybe another cat memeâ€”just like you did before. But this time, the file gets split into multiple shards.

```js
const client = await Client.create()
const files = await filesFromPaths(['./awesome-cat-meme.jpg'])
```

**3. Print Each Shardâ€™s CID**

As each shard is stored, youâ€™ll print out its CID. Think of these as the pieces of your compression puzzle.

```js
const root = await client.uploadDirectory(files, {
  onShardStored: shard => console.log(shard.cid.toString())
})
```

**4. Reveal the DAG Root**

After all the shards are uploaded, print the CID of the root of the DAG. This is the final piece that ties everything together.

```js
console.log(root.toString())
```

## Why Itâ€™s Awesome:

**Efficiency:** Youâ€™re not just uploading dataâ€”youâ€™re breaking it down and managing it in a super-efficient way.

**Organization:** The DAG structure helps keep your data neatly organized, and the CIDs act as a digital map to navigate it all.

**No Redundant Uploads:** Thanks to content addressing, if the data already exists, you donâ€™t need to send it againâ€”saving time and bandwidth.

## Next Steps:

**1. Run the Code:** Try running your code to see the CIDs of each shard and the final DAG root.

**2. Explore Further:** Think about how this structure could be used in larger projects or how you might expand on it.

Now, itâ€™s your turn to dive into the world of infinite compression! Good luck, and have fun compressing! ðŸš€
