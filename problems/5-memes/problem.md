# Memes for my eyes

Ain't you cool? Now, let's shift gears and dive into the next challenge: retrieving content from a decentralized network.

## The Challenge:

Every meme (or any other file) you upload is instantly available for retrieval. In this exercise, your task is to fetch a text file from a public gateway using its root CID. The cool part? You can use any gateway, thanks to the decentralized nature of peer-to-peer networking. But for simplicity, weâ€™ll use the `storacha.link` gateway.

## What You Need to Do:

**1. Start by creating a new JavaScript file, ex6.mjs.**

**2. Fetch the CID from `stdin`**

The CID (Content Identifier) of the file you need to fetch will be provided via `process.stdin`. Youâ€™ll need to read this input first.

```js
import fs from 'node:fs'
import { CID } from 'multiformats'

const cid = CID.decode(fs.readFileSync(process.stdin.fd))
```

**3. Construct the Gateway URL**

Format the URL to fetch the content using the `storacha.link` gateway. The URL format is:

```js
https://storacha.link/ipfs/<CID>
```

Replace <CID> with the actual CID you decoded.

```js
const url = `https://storacha.link/ipfs/${cid}`
```

**4. Fetch the Content**

Use the fetch API to send an HTTP request to the gateway and retrieve the data.

```js
const res = await fetch(url)
```

**5. Output the Content**

Finally, write the fetched content directly to `process.stdout`.

```js
process.stdout.write(await res.text())
```

## Whatâ€™s Happening Here?

**CID Decoding:** The CID you receive is in a compact binary form. You use the multiformats library to decode it into a human-readable string that you can use in the URL.

**Gateway Flexibility:** We use storacha.link here, but you can use any IPFS gateway.

**Real-time Retrieval:** Once you have the CID, fetching content from a decentralized network is as simple as sending a request to a URL.

## Why This is Cool:

This challenge shows you how easy it is to retrieve content from a decentralized network. Itâ€™s like pulling a meme out of thin airâ€”instant access, no matter where the file is stored on the network.

Now, create that `ex6.mjs` file, plug in your code, and see how seamlessly you can fetch content from the decentralized web. Happy coding! ðŸš€

**Next Steps:**

- Try fetching different types of content by changing the CID.
- Explore how different gateways work and compare their performance.

Youâ€™re doing greatâ€”keep pushing forward!
