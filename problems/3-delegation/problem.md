# Delegation, invocation and procrastination

Excellent cat memes. Well done you.

Now, lets talk UCAN.

## What are UCANs?

UCANs (User Controlled Authorization Networks) are like supercharged passwords. They’re used for secure, decentralized authorization. When you create a UCAN, you sign it with your private key, kind of like signing a document with your unique signature.

## Why are UCANs cool?

The best thing about UCANs is that you can securely give permission to others to do things on your behalf without sharing your private key. This is called "delegation".

## Your Mission

In this exercise, you're going to delegate an `upload/list` capability to the workshop. The workshop will create its own private key and pass its public key (DID) to you via `stdin` (standard input).

Your program should read from `process.stdin`, create a delegation for the `upload/list` capability and write it to `process.stdout`. So, something like this:

```
DID => your program => delegation
```

Then the workshop will be able to **invoke** the capability to list the items _you've_ uploaded to _your_ space. It'll verify it can find that cat meme you uploaded in the previous exercise.

One last thing, make sure the delegation remains valid for **more than one hour**.

**Steps to complete the task**

**1. Create new file and read a DID from `stdin`**

Create new file, like `ex4.mjs` and then you can read and parse the DID from `process.stdin`:

```js
import fs from 'node:fs'
import * as DID from '@ipld/dag-ucan/did'

const data = fs.readFileSync(process.stdin.fd, 'utf-8')
const principal = DID.parse(data)
```

**2. Create the delegetion**

Use the client to create a delegation for `upload/list` to the provided DID:

```js
import * as Client from '@web3-storage/w3up-client'
```

Create the client and set the expiration time for the delegation:

```js
const client = await Client.create()
const twoHours = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 2 // Two hours in milliseconds
```
In the example above, it is set to two hours.

**3. Generate the delegation**

Create the delegation for the `upload/list` capability:

```js
const delegation = await client.createDelegation(principal, ['upload/list'], {
  // Expiration is in seconds from Unix epoch
  expiration: Math.round((Date.now() + twoHours) / 1000),
})
```

**4. Archive the delegation**

Archive the delegation and handle any errors:

```js
const { ok: archive, error } = await delegation.archive()
if (!archive) {
  throw new Error('Failed to create delegation archive', { cause: error })
}
```

**5. Output the delegation**

Write the delegation to `process.stdout`:

```js
process.stdout.write(archive)
```
